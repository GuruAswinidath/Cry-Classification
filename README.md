# Cry-Classification

This study addresses the challenge of automatically interpreting and classifying baby cries to discern various needs such as hunger, burping, tiredness, discomfort, or belly pain. Existing research lacks precise differentiation among these states from cry patterns. To bridge this gap, our research employs advanced analytic tools on a dataset comprising recordings of baby cries. Initially, audio files are processed through an MFCC converter to extract relevant characteristics, followed by PCA for dimensionality reduction. Various machine learning models are then applied to classify cry patterns.

The primary aim is to enhance caregiving practices by providing caregivers with a tool to better attend to infants' needs. The novelty lies in achieving higher classification accuracy 95\% using a decision tree classifier compared to existing methods. This approach not only improves the newborn environment but also contributes to pediatric healthcare and early childhood development. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring its potential to revolutionize how caregivers respond to infants' cries, thereby promoting better overall caregiving practices.
